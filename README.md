I hold a **Bachelor's Degree in English Studies** and a **Master's Degree in Spanish Linguistics**. I’m now studying a **Microsoft IT Support Specialist Professional Certificate**. I have a **C2 English level** (full professional proficiency) certified by Cambridge, which I consolidated by living and working in the United Kingdom for 4 years.
